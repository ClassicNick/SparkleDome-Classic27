#SparkleDome-Classic web browser

This is the source code for the SparkleDome-Classic web browser, an independent
browser derived from Firefox/Mozilla community code. The source tree is
mostly laid out like other Mozilla-based products. While this is independant
from Firefox, it does share a massive amount of Mozilla code with it.

An explanation of the Mozilla Source Code Directory Structure and links to
project pages with documentation can be found at:
